# Python-Web-Scraper
Just a simple web scraper that I'm building to gain more experience with python and potentially use in future projects. At the moment this repository contains a tool for scraping job opporunities from monster.com, a static website that can be parsed statically without having to log in or run a javascript designed to build the webpage.

# Future Improvements
-Scrape dynamically built webpages
-Send login data to gain access to the target website
-Automate the scraping process to check for new opportunities, product availability, breaking news on a given topic, etc
